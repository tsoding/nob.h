# No changes to the public API

PRs that change and/or extend the public API of the library are not accepted. Only PRs that change the internals in a backward and forward compatible way are considered. Changing the public API is only authorized to [@rexim](https://github.com/rexim). If you need a certain feature that requires changing the public API, implement it yourself in your local copy of nob.h or create an issue about it and [@rexim](https://github.com/rexim) may consider implementing it if it's useful.
